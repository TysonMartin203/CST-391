**Research Summary**

1. **Write a one-paragraph summary of the new features that have been added. Define new terminology that was used in the lesson.**

In this lesson, new features were added to the React application including dynamic component rendering, form management, and update functionality. A dynamic blog post mini-application demonstrated adding and removing items from a list by using useState, callback functions, and controlled components, where each form fieldâ€™s value is linked to state and updated on every change. The main music app was expanded by adding tracks, lyrics, and video placeholders through child components like TracksList, TrackTitle, TrackLyrics, and TrackVideo. A major feature added was the ability to create and edit albums using a shared EditAlbum component, with useNavigate enabling page redirection after form submission. Axios continued to be used for server communication, while REST principles (POST for creation, PUT for modification) guided backend interactions. New concepts such as "spread syntax" for managing arrays, "controlled components" for form handling, and differentiating between props and state updates were crucial for managing dynamic user interfaces and improving application scalability.
