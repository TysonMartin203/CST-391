**Research Summary**

1. **Write a one-paragraph summary of the new features that have been added. Define new terminology that was used in the lesson.**

The new features added in this lesson include building custom React components, using props to pass data between components, and managing dynamic data with state and hooks. Components allow React applications to be broken down into reusable pieces, each representing a part of the UI. Props are short for "properties" and enable parent components to pass data down to child components, remaining static after initial rendering. State, on the other hand, allows a component to create and manage its own changing data over time. The lesson also introduced hooks, specifically the useState hook, which provides a way for functional components to manage state without needing class components. Additionally, the map function was used to dynamically render a list of components based on an array of data, demonstrating efficient iteration and rendering in React. Flexbox styling from CSS was used to organize components horizontally, and Bootstrap was integrated via CDN to provide prebuilt responsive design elements for better UI presentation.
